                If in 7 days you don&apos;t feel 100% confident that you could go out and sign your
                first paying client, I&apos;ll refund every penny, no questions asked.
              </p>
              <p>
                Just email my support team at support@brandscalingbootcamp.com, say &quot;refund
                please,&quot; add your purchase email and you&apos;ll have your money back within 48 hours.
              </p>

                I can make this guarantee because I know my audience really well. I&apos;ve seen what
                happens when people actually follow the system.
              </p>
              <p>And I know that if you do the work, the results are basically inevitable.</p>
              <p>The only people who don&apos;t get results are the ones who don&apos;t show up.</p>
              <p>So show up. I&apos;ll handle the rest.</p>
