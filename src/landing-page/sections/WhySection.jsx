                <p>Fair question.</p>
                <p>
                  I&apos;ve seen people charge $997 for less than what I&apos;m giving you here. And I could
                  probably charge $297+ and still fill this thing.
                </p>
                <p>But here&apos;s my logic:</p>
                <p>I&apos;m not trying to make money on this bootcamp.</p>
                <p>
                  I&apos;m trying to find 1,000 people who are serious about building online income,
                  and help them get their first win.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Some of those people will go on to join my higher-level programs. Some will become
                  clients. Some will become partners. Some will just succeed on their own and tell
                  their friends about me.
                </p>
                <p>All of those outcomes are wins for me.</p>
                <p>
                  The <strong>$47</strong> covers my ad costs and filters out the people who aren&apos;t
                  serious. That&apos;s it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This is the best deal I&apos;ll ever offer. And I&apos;ll probably never run it at this
                  price again.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Once I have enough success stories from this cohort, the price goes up permanently.
